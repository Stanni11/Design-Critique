            <p class="p_productDescription">We will review your designs (website or mobile/web app) and explore where
                the design works well and where
                it can be improved. We focus our process around one central question: “What can we do to make this
                design more efficient?” </p>

                <p class="p_h3">Unlike any other design review or audit, we will not only tell you what can be
                    improved but also make revamps to the most critical parts of the design.</p>
                <h3 class="h3">Design Report </h3>
                <p class="p_h3">We will evaluate your design based on a variety of parameters and provide
                    a detailed visual report with useful tips and design hacks. This would be the starting point for
                    further work on the design.</p>
                <h3 class="h3">Ways to Redesign</h3>
                <p class="p_h3">We provide several strategies for further redesign by various
                    contractors, from freelancers to high-end agencies. We provide you with an assessment of the
                    timing and cost for both a full redesign and quick but effective improvements.</p>
